                <h2>How We Started</h2>
                <p>Delhi Public School Budgam is located in the Humhama/Sheikhpura area, 2.5 km from the Srinagar International Airport. The School campus is spread over seven acres.
                    The school was established in 2008 and has quickly become one of the finest institutions in Kashmir. While the main school building was completed in 2010, the school is currently being expanded to accommodate additional students. A sports field, basketball court and a childrens park have been developed. Future enhancements include a planned swimming pool, two tennis courts and an auditorium.The school campus sits at a height from which many parts of Srinagar city can be seen. The campus is 0.5 kilometres from the main road, which implies a pollution free and quiet environment that children can enjoy every day. In less than 10 years of operation, the school has grown to almost 3,000 students. We prize diversity in our student body and welcome students from different socio-economic backgrounds. More than forty (40) percent are girls and we hope to increase this share to 50 percent in the coming years. We also offer full scholarships to a few bright students who come from economically underprivileged families.
                    DPS Budgam does not discriminate among its students on the basis of race, colour, national or ethnic origin, religion or gender. Delhi Public School, Budgam is run by The Society for Promotion of Culture and Education Trust (Registered).
